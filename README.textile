h1. awesomereorder â€” a lightweight, simple, drag-and-drop list reordering plugin

h2. why bother?

There are a million different jQuery plugins out there that do different things with ordering lists, but they're all more focused on fancy animations and contextual sorting than they are in a simple, friendly, "I want to drag these elements around" sort of way. They're just lists, right? It shouldn't be difficult to write a plugin that'll just take any old HTML list and make it so that you can drag around the elements and reorder them.

And in fact, it's not difficult. It's just tedious and annoying to account for all the edge cases. I finally got sick of writing a version of this for every project that needed one, so I finally decided to wrap it all into a reusable plugin.

h2. prerequisites

* *jQuery*. I develop against jQuery 1.4.4 and 1.5.2.
* *jQuery UI Draggable*. Doesn't matter how you include it, as long as it's there. I support jQuery UI 1.8.6+.
* *a list*. @<ul>@, @<ol>@, bunch of @<div>@s in a @<div>@, block, inline, it doesn't really matter. @<dl>@s are a bit out there, though, I can't really deal with those properly.

h2. demo

"Go here":http://dev.dontexplain.com/awesomereorder/example/index.html for a couple of demos. It'll look nicer if you have a modern browser, since all the pretty stuff is in CSS3.

h2. browsers

I test on Chrome 12, Safari 5, Firefox 3.6, and IE 7, 8, and 9. More will come if requested.
