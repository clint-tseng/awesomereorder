h1. awesomereorder â€” a lightweight, simple, drag-and-drop list reordering plugin

h2. why bother?

There are a million different jQuery plugins out there that do different things with ordering lists, but they're all more focused on fancy animations and contextual sorting than they are in a simple, friendly, "I want to drag these elements around" sort of way. They're just lists, right? It shouldn't be difficult to write a plugin that'll just take any old HTML list and make it so that you can drag around the elements and reorder them.

And in fact, it's not difficult. It's just tedious and annoying to account for all the edge cases. I finally got sick of writing a version of this for every project that needed one, so I finally decided to wrap it all into a reusable plugin.

h2. prerequisites

* *jQuery*. I'm testing against version 1.5.2 at the moment; support for older versions will come if requested.
* *jQuery UI Draggable*. Doesn't matter how you include it, as long as it's there.
* *a list*. @<ul>@, @<ol>@, block, inline, it doesn't really matter. @<dl>@s are a bit out there, though, I'm not sure how I'd deal with those.

h2. demo

"Go here":http://dev.dontexplain.com/awesomereorder/example/index.html for a couple of demos. It'll look nicer if you have a modern browser, since all the pretty stuff is in CSS3.

h2. browsers

Right now, I've tested Chrome 12.0.712.0. I've been working on this thing for 2 hours so far; cut me some slack. =)
